
notification body requests cheatsheet

send request {
	sender: sender's ID
	recipient: recipient's ID
	status: sent
}

original send request in user's notif list to be considered 'read'

accept request {
	notifID: the ID of the recipient's original notification
		thus, the notif they recieve when sender sends request
	sender: user who sent the request (original notif recieved includes it)
	recipient: recipients ID
	twinID: the sender's notification
	status: accepted or ignored
}

once accepted OR ignored, notif is to be considered 'read' on front end
notification of sender's request being accepted has status: accepted,
  but also has 'read' key. Can be set to 'true' in order to be marked read



tag alert {
	sender: original poster
	postID: 
	invited: [array of IDs for all invited users]
}

tagged alert {
	senderID: original poster's id
	postID:
	read: false
}
users can mark this notif as 'read' simply by reading the post
or (perhaps) selecting a check
