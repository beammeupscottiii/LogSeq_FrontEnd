@1028 Header date functionality is workinggg. 
	  State variable for date info also implemented

07. 03. 2022
@1144 Made some headway in getting date info into state variables.
	  Would be redundant to have to make individual hooks for each T- T Will see
	  if I can add them all into on state object....

@1110 Current objective is to create a state object with the current Date info
	 and updateable currently view Date info.
	 When user logs in and is active - current Month, Day, Year is logged, displayed.
	 once scrolling through older posts, currentlyViewed Month, Day and Year is displayed

	 unsure how to implement this currently, 
	 react wont take functions as element child (as variable for innerHTML)

@0833 User now stays loggedIn upon successful log in

@1205 App not remaining within home upon refresh. useEffect within App.js will run the
	console.log function if the dependency has a value, but not the setState functions.
	may have something to do with those functions inherently being asynchronous?

@1107 App running useEffect ... twice ... due to sessionStorage. a success, i suppose
		Could look up already working methods of keeping track of a loggedIn user online

@1011 Need use of sessionStorage in order to keep user signed in (especially during dev)

@0958 Fixed that issue with a prevent default with the switching button

@0921 Switching from login to signup causes the form to be submitted and make an API call.
	  I've currently no idea why and it seems like a potential security concern :/

@1045 the sequence after a successful signup FINALLY works
	  Not even sure what I was doing incorrectly beforehand, regarding
	  useEffect. However, having both the dependancy variable for the 
	  function and another for an if variable to be dependant on was 
	  necessary for it to work correctly.

	  As of now, returning a clearTimeout doesnt seem to be necessary +
	  causes the script to then work incorrectly

	  Next steps:
	  - have button underneath submit that allows user to switch to
	  	other component section (userSignUp has switch for userLogIn) ✔️ (07.01.2022) 
	  - disable text fields and submit button while awaiting API feedback
	  - fix functionality for header, to properly display days n such ✔️ (07.04.2022)

	  - then, CSS !

@1739 having trouble within setTimeout and the pattern that runs after successful
	  user signup.
	  should the different timeouts be seperated?

06. 20. 2022
@0900 logic for checking when isLoggedIn becomes filled
	  and to switch to home works!

	  need to put functions for creating the dated header
	  outside of the header/home component

	  next, when user is successfully created using userSignUp,
	  userSignUp should go false, then userSignIn opens
	  also, disable submit button and inputs during submit

@0842 userLogin part of userEntry works :D !
	  once isLoggedIn becomes set, within app.js,
	  to unmount userEntry and switch to home

@1522 Added some more things x'D
	  Further develop userEntry....

06.18.2022
@1100 Wrote out initial skeleton for the forms, and not much else.
	  Will write out header component next.
	  Can connect app to API while its running on my phone.
	  Ensure userEntry component works as intended:
	    - user sign up should return user to user log in
	    - successful user login should take user to 'home'
	    	- for now, header will change to signify successful entry

	  After all this is done - then, css :D
