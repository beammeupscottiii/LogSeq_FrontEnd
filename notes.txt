Currently Working On:
components/UserMenu
components/MenuToggle

07. 12. 2022
@2053 Barebones structure now works as intended!
@2043 Fixed previous issue - now form for createPost is only reading the tags :/

@2031 Begun building skeletons for menuButton and userMenu
			for some reason, some functions are being intepreted as strings within userMenu :/

@1153 No Posts Today H1 still loads before blog posts do. Hmm, would like to fix

@1104 Plan for UserMenu

UserMenu is an overarching component that (will) include(s):
- Buttons for switching site sections (myLog, theirLog, user settings and tags)
- Buttons for managing posts (create, update, delete)
- Forms for Entries and Events
	(perhaps actual forms will be seperate 'pages' done with Router. For now, within UserMenu)

MenuButton
- Toggles the UserMenu to open
- Should be interesting to figure out / learn how to have the text shift from 'Menu' to X

Will need to begin implementing some CSS styling for these two components


Currently Working On:
components/BlogLog/Daylog

07. 12. 2022
@1100 blog posts now load in correct fashion
			- As of now, plan to build out initial version of Daylog complete. Very barebones, as with everything else

@1029 fixed the issue with No Posts Today h1. It (should) now be working correctly

@0946 Just noticed that posts are loading oldest first - we need newest first. Should be fun to right whatever script I need to change that.


07. 11. 2022
@1656 Posts now display correctly and conditionally renders No Posts Today h1
		  - need to find way to post add header with date between posts

@1521 Working on getting posts to be displayed now ...

07. 10. 2022
@1532 data from api call is now displaying correctly upon login. React really is a different beast . . .

07. 09. 2022
@2050 Currently, during dev mode, useEffect runs twice. Well, this isn't exactly use effect,
but the console.log within DayLog runs twice. on first run, it's empty. Second run, elements appear.
Well, I can access the data within Daylog, so well consider this a success...

@2020 the loadlog function is now working as intended (the user auth token wasn't being passed correctly this whole time). However, data isn't showing up within state variable (._. )
Probably has something to do with the async of it all T- T

07. 07. 2022
@1018 Initial set up for BlogLog. 
			Now testing API endpoint, but is currently not working

07. 06. 2022
@1209 Added new fields to posts model. need to write psuedocode sequence for getting posts within specific month and year range.
Will need to know how to pass variables into url for api requests.

@1130 using .createdAt isnt sufficient. Will have to create new 'postedOn' fields to posts
	  that are automatically created for each entry. 
	  boolean for 'usePostedByDate' for entries and events being posted in the present
	  so that 'postedOn' fields get created and filled out 

@1102 have to design the API controller for returning all posts from a specific month.
	  As of now, posts automatically have a creation date stamp, we'll start with that.

07. 05. 2022
Gonna work on parts of certain components first so that we can pull together a cohesive 
project / product 'sooner'

Main component: BlogLog
SubComponents:
- DayLog
- WeekList
- Month Chart
- Toggle Button (switch between states)

Main component gets all posts from/with API and stores them in object (current month's posts)
- Daylog displays all posts chronologically, most recent to least. 
  - Will need to implement logic to add header with date above all posts with corresponding date.
    - If current date is July 5th, but most recent post was June 25th, header with June 25th, 2022 appears above all posts with that date. Continues
- For current implementation of Daylog, simply build component as long list. Will attend to swiping functionality and css later

After:
component for displaying full post (may need to start using Router around this point)
LogCRUD for creating new posts.

First part of LogCRUD - create:
Make menu button which toggles LogCRUD menu, 
"Create" being first section developed. 
(especially as creating entries and events has series of steps T- T)




Current Project:
components/userEntry
components/header

07. 04. 2022
@1028 Header date functionality is workinggg. 
	  State variable for date info also implemented

07. 03. 2022
@1144 Made some headway in getting date info into state variables.
	  Would be redundant to have to make individual hooks for each T- T Will see
	  if I can add them all into on state object....

@1110 Current objective is to create a state object with the current Date info
	 and updateable currently view Date info.
	 When user logs in and is active - current Month, Day, Year is logged, displayed.
	 once scrolling through older posts, currentlyViewed Month, Day and Year is displayed

	 unsure how to implement this currently, 
	 react wont take functions as element child (as variable for innerHTML)

@0833 User now stays loggedIn upon successful log in 

07. 01. 2022
@1205 App not remaining within home upon refresh. useEffect within App.js will run the
	console.log function if the dependency has a value, but not the setState functions.
	may have something to do with those functions inherently being asynchronous?

@1107 App running useEffect ... twice ... due to sessionStorage. a success, i suppose
		Could look up already working methods of keeping track of a loggedIn user online

@1011 Need use of sessionStorage in order to keep user signed in (especially during dev)

@0958 Fixed that issue with a prevent default with the switching button

@0921 Switching from login to signup causes the form to be submitted and make an API call.
	  I've currently no idea why and it seems like a potential security concern :/

06. 30. 2022
@1045 the sequence after a successful signup FINALLY works
	  Not even sure what I was doing incorrectly beforehand, regarding
	  useEffect. However, having both the dependancy variable for the 
	  function and another for an if variable to be dependant on was 
	  necessary for it to work correctly.

	  As of now, returning a clearTimeout doesnt seem to be necessary +
	  causes the script to then work incorrectly

	  Next steps:
	  - have button underneath submit that allows user to switch to
	  	other component section (userSignUp has switch for userLogIn) ✔️ (07.01.2022) 
	  - disable text fields and submit button while awaiting API feedback
	  - fix functionality for header, to properly display days n such ✔️ (07.04.2022)

	  - then, CSS !

06. 27. 2022
@1739 having trouble within setTimeout and the pattern that runs after successful
	  user signup.
	  should the different timeouts be seperated?

06. 20. 2022
@0900 logic for checking when isLoggedIn becomes filled
	  and to switch to home works!

	  need to put functions for creating the dated header
	  outside of the header/home component

	  next, when user is successfully created using userSignUp,
	  userSignUp should go false, then userSignIn opens
	  also, disable submit button and inputs during submit

@0842 userLogin part of userEntry works :D !
	  once isLoggedIn becomes set, within app.js,
	  to unmount userEntry and switch to home

06. 19. 2022
@1522 Added some more things x'D
	  Further develop userEntry....

06.18.2022
@1100 Wrote out initial skeleton for the forms, and not much else.
	  Will write out header component next.
	  Can connect app to API while its running on my phone.
	  Ensure userEntry component works as intended:
	    - user sign up should return user to user log in
	    - successful user login should take user to 'home'
	    	- for now, header will change to signify successful entry

	  After all this is done - then, css :D
