@0900 logic for checking when isLoggedIn becomes filled
	  and to switch to home works!

	  need to put functions for creating the dated header
	  outside of the header/home component

@0842 userLogin part of userEntry works :D !
	  once isLoggedIn becomes set, within app.js,
	  to unmount userEntry and switch to home

@1522 Added some more things x'D
	  Further develop userEntry....

@1100 Wrote out initial skeleton for the forms, and not much else.
	  Will write out header component next.
	  Can connect app to API while its running on my phone.
	  Ensure userEntry component works as intended:
	    - user sign up should return user to user log in
	    - successful user login should take user to 'home'
	    	- for now, header will change to signify successful entry

	  After all this is done - then, css :D
